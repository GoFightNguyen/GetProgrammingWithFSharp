## What is F#
F# is a functional-first programming language. While it encourages us to write code in a functional programming (FP) style,  it does not force us.

Although it supports OO features, we will be focusing on the FP side of things.

## What is functional programming (FP)
The author suggests any FP language should have good support for a few core fundamentals:
* _immutability_ - the ability to create values that can never be changed in their lifetime, which leads to a clear separation of data and functionality
* _expressions_ - the notion that every operation in your program has a tangible output that can be reasoned about
* _functions as values_ - the ability to easily create, use, and share funcations as a unit of abstraction and composition with a system

## F# is part of .NET
F# is a statically typed language. At runtime, F# is compiled into Intermediary Language (IL) and is hosted on the .NET CLR.

F# has the same language features across .NET implementations although the tool-chain differs.
