# Lesson 42 Web Testing
This lesson was mostly about using Canopy.

Canopy is an open-source library wrapping the Selenium plugin.
It provides a simple, easy-to-use DSL for writing basic scripts that can control your web browser.

Canopy has a simple test runner that can launch directly from a script or a console application.
Of course, Canopy can be used with other test runners.
You declare events and tests through a set of functions, before starting a test run.

Although Canopy is not a pure functional library (a global state exists behind the scenes with mutable properties), it is a practical library making web automation simple.

Refer to the book for more info and examples.
